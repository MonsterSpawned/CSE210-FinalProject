## Bryan

### A Text Based, Story/Narrative driven game (D&D Style)

#### (**(?) = Potential**)

* Will have crafting

* Will have NPCs, good and bad, dialogue, etc

* Items (both for NPCs and the player)

* Will have a "Map" of sorts

* Will have a level loading system (?)

* A game save/load system will also be implemented, if we have time (?)

* Will have a modding/extension system (if we have time) (?)

* Will either be written on Raylib or from scratch using Python's input() method.

* And more...
